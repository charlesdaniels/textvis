# textvis

Text Visualization project for CSCE567

## Objective

The objective of this project is to produce a visualization framework which
makes it easy to show relationships between pieces of English text. In
particular, it should support multi-level hierarchical relationships -- fore
example a set of paragraphs might be related to one another based on their
order in the document, but a specific sentence within one paragraph might be
related to another specific sentence in another paragraph by some other metric.

## Approach

This project will be implemented using d3.js, and in particular
[d3-force](https://github.com/d3/d3-force).
