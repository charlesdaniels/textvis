            <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <p>

            Welcome to TextVis. TextVis is a JavaScript + d3.js library for
            visualizing relationships between sentences of text. TextVis is
            specially designed for reviewing the results of certain classes of
            NLP programs, such as topic flow detection, antecedent analysis,
            and the like. TextVis can also be used to display manually
            annotated relationships between sentences.

            </p>

            <p>

            TextVis takes as input a simple, easy to hand-write or generate
            JSON format. This dashboard is designed to demonstrate how to use
            TextVis, and also allow you to upload your own JSON files to see
            how TextVis will display them. If you want to use TextVis as part
            of a serious project, you should probably call it as a library from
            your own HTML/js code.

            </p>

            <h1>JSON Format</h1>

            <p>

            Please review the two provided example pages. Both of these feature
            example JSON code for you to download and review. The following is
            a specification or the schema of said JSON code.

            </p>

            <p>

            The input JSON file should contain two arrays, <b>paragraphs</b>
            and <b>relations</b>.

            </p>

            <p>

            The <b>paragraphs</b> array should be a list of objects which
            must define the following members:

            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>index</code>, The paragraph number, as an
                    integer.</li>
                <li><code>sentences</code>, A list of sentence objects.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>

            A <b>sentence</b> object must define the following members:

            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>index</code>, The sentence number, as an integer.
                    This should not be unique, but rather relative to the
                    beginning of the parent paragraph.</li>
                <li><code>words</code>, A string containing the words of the
                    sentence.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>

            The <b>relations</b> array should be a list of relation objects,
            which must define the following members:

            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>from</code>, A marker object.</li>
                <li><code>to</code>, A marker object.</li>
                <li><code>annotation</code>, A string to be shown in a tooltip
                    when the relation is moused over. May be left empty, but
                    must be defined.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>

            A <b>marker</b> object must define the following members:

            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>paragraph</code>, The paragraph number of the
                    marker.</li>
                <li><code>sentence</code>, The sentence number of the
                    marker.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>NOTE: </b> sentence and paragraph numbers are 0-indexed.
